The following folder contains all the functions required in order to run the CPC and eCPC (CPC-extra) algorithms.
There are 4 examples on a real AC induction motor from the Tel Aviv University Power conversion lab:
1. A reference measurement of the motor without any changes
2. The motor with 1 screw that was dismounted.
3. The motor with 4 screws that were dismounted.
4. The motor with 6 screws that were dismounted.

Each of the use-cases has 2 M files - one with CPC and one with eCPC.

Instructions for running the examples:
1. Download all the files to the same directory.
2. Open the wanted use-cases' M file and run it.
3. In the end, many graphs with the CPC and eCPC components will be opened.

ENJOY
